## What is static site generation?
By generating static content as part of the build process, we can eliminate many of the issues with dynamic websites
and lead to improved performance, security and ease of use.

This has many benefits. The most noticeable is performance. HTTP servers are very good at sending filesâ€”so good, in fact, that you can effectively serve the same number of pages with a fraction of the memory and CPU needed for a dynamic site.

## What is Hugo?
Hugo is just one example of a static website generator, it uses GoLang for templates and will render content into HTML files so these can be cached by a CDN - this whole process of parsing and creating HTML files is blazingly quick.
 say that Hugo is a static site generator.
